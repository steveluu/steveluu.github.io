At GreenShield, I served as VP of Product, leading the product and design teams across insurance, health, and admin platforms. I launched GS+, a first-of-its-kind payer-provider platform combining benefits, virtual therapy, digital pharmacy, and telemedicine. I also developed products in care navigation and chronic disease management, hired the early team and consulting partners, led partner integrations, and played a key role in two acquisitions.
